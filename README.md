## Get creative.
Hi there. We've done quite a bit of writing HTML & CSS
to match layouts. Now it's your turn to get creative.
Use the HTML you've been given, and design it to your liking.
BUT...you have to use the requirements below:

## Layout requirements

* A header with a full-width background image
* The paragraphs at the top should feature a 2 column grid
* The quote in the intro should be centered
* At the bottom, include at least 2 links to your favorite coffee company
* The individual coffee options should conform to a grid. The number of columns is up to you.

## Technical requirements

* Put CSS in separate file
* Use a webfont
* Specify line-height
* Use the inline-block method to create a grid

## Bonus

* CSS-only drop cap on first letter of first paragraph.

### Nicely designed gridded sites
